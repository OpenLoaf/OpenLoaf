## 📝 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

OpenLoaf uses a dual-licensing model (AGPLv3 + Commercial License). To allow us to continue providing this model, **all contributors must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**.

When you open your first Pull Request, a CLA assistant bot will automatically comment on your PR and ask you to sign the CLA using your GitHub account.

You only need to sign the CLA once. If you modify your PR or open new PRs in the future, you won't be asked to sign it again (unless the terms of the CLA change).

You can read the full text of our CLA [here](./CLA.md).
